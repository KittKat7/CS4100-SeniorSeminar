### What final topic am I most interested in hearing about?

The topic I am most interested in by far... is *why are cars using touchscreens
for everything*?
I am also very annoyed by how car companies are using touchscreens for more and
more. Sure, I love having a nice screen for backup cameras, or for map
navigation, but some things do **NOT** need to be on a touchscreen.

The craziest instance of this is Tesla using the touchscreen for shifting
(absolutely crazy), but a more common instance is putting temperature controls
on touchscreens. These changes require more attention that physical buttons,
making it harder to change safely while driving.
