### Ethics Discussion
Date: {{ DATE }}

---

Here are my thoughts on the discussions. A lot of people were self identified as utilitarians. I
think my morals mostly align with utilitarianism, except I think I focus a lot more on the
minimizing suffering and less on the maximizing happiness. I don't know why, but this distinction
feels important to me. Maybe I value this distinction because I tend to focus on what I want more
(obviously, I don't want things that hurt others, hence the focus on minimizing suffering).

There were also several people who mentioned religion and the bible as a source for their moral/
ethical code. Personally, I am not religous. I hav had religion used as a weapon against me far more
than it has ever been used to help me, so I end up not putting a lot of faith (pun intended) in
religion. Now, I really don't care if others are religius. If it helps them, great! More power to
them, but please, don't force it onto me.
