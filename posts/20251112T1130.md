**For this assignment, select a generative AI area of interest, choose a tool, create a project by Wednesday, and then describe your process, tool used, and experience in the text box.**

I chose to make a game in a web app using ChatGPT (this idea was also inspired by ChatGPT).

The experience was very fast and easy. My initial prompt was

*Write a short adventure story game. This game should be based in a future timeset. Then, make a (static) webapp to play the game and include all the necesary files to make it a PWA. Make sure the webapp looks really nice!*

The result was very usable, but there were a few specific tweaks I had to ask for. ChatGPT was very effective at making these minor changes.

The finished project can be accessed [here](./echoes/)
