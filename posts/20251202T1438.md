### Final Blog Post

**Describe the three most important things you learned this semester, and offer
one piece of advice to future students in this class**

**Things I learned**
1. A lot about bees and honey. When a queen bee leaves the hive to find a new
   one, the worker bees that go with the queen are much more interested in
   protecting the queen than they are in attacking you!

2. Edward Snowden. I had heard Snowden mentioned before, but that was it.
   Learning more about who he was and what is did was really interesting. This
   was honestly, my favorite section in class.

3. AI is not very smart. I already knew this, but I didn't how not smart. It is
   expected that AI will run out of new training data by around 2030. It seems
   it may not get much smarter, meaning, I am less worried about it taking my
   job!

**Advice**  
Show up to class -- I know, very original advice -- but seriously, this class
was one of my favorite classes. There were lots of very interesting discussions
in class which contained lots of very interesting information.
