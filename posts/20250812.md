**Best in-class computing experience...**

I don't know about "best", but my favorite in-class computing experience was connecting my laptop to the monitors in the lab rooms to see how many monitors I could use for lab.

**Best out-of-class computing experience...**

Anytime my computer works as expected/I don't have to troubleshoot and fix something.
