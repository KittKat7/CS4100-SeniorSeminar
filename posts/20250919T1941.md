### Hive Tracks Discussion
Date: {{ DATE }}

---

Thinks I learned from the Hive Tracks discussions.

1. Bees swarm when a queen leaves the hive, and usually the swarms are not
very aggressive (even though they look very scary). (This was probably the most
interesting thing I learned)

2. Locations of beehives could be counted as trade secrets. Bad actor beekeepers
could use the information to steal bees. Other beekeepers could use this info to
find where good locations for their hives are.

3. Different sources of nectar produce different types / values of honey.


4. (bonus) I didn't know beekeepers would ship their bees off to almond/other
farms to pollinate them.
