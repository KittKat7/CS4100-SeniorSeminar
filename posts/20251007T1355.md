### Edward Snowden v. NSA
Date: {{ DATE }}

---

This was a very interesting documentary. My biggest takeaway? The government is
watching everything! Jk, I knew that already. I think that I am probably more
aware of this then most average people (just from more experience with tech), so
maybe I can use this documentary to help inform others of this.

Actually, my biggest takeaway was that is it really hard to monitor and regulate
what intelligence agencies are actually doing.
