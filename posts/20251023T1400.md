### What did you find & Privacy policies
Date: {{ DATE }}

---

I thought the discussions and activities were really interesting. I wasnt
surprised by anything that was found on me during the *What Did You Find*
assignment. I have already done several searches on myself, and nothing new was
found during the activity. I was very surprised at how much was able to be found
about others. I was also surprised during the privacy policy discussion when
someone shared that discord sends **ALL** messages to 3rd parties. I never
through discord was a secure place for messaging and I assumed they were
collecting all messages, but I didn't expect them to have a 3rd party actually
analyze all messages.
